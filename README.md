<h4 align="center">Junior Full-Stack Developer and Content Creator</h4>
<hr>

I'm a curious and creative Junior Full-Stack Developer, coming from a Marketing and communication background, who recently graduated from Makers Academy.
I moved to London in 2018 to improve my skills as a content creator and here I've found my new passion, or better, I like to say that programming found me. 👩🏻‍💻

I'm moved by knowledge and challenges, learning new things and putting them into practice has always been essential to me, in my 20s I moved to Tokyo, to learn Japanese, and in 2014 I've learned all that I needed to know about social media marketing, creating a Youtube Channel that has been my business for many years. 🗼

As a creative, programming gives me the tools to develop all of my ideas and to keep me challenged every day. 🌱
