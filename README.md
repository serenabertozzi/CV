<h4 align="center">Junior Full-Stack Developer and Content Creator</h4>

I'm a curious and creative Junior Full-Stack Developer, coming from a Marketing and communication background, who recently graduated from Makers Academy.
I moved to London in 2018 to improve my skills as a content creator and here I've found my new passion, or better, I like to say that programming found me instead. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

I'm moved by knowledge and challenges, learning new things and putting them into practice has always been essential to me, in my 20s I moved to Tokyo, to learn Japanese, and in 2014 I've learned all that I needed to know about social media marketing, creating a Youtube Channel that has been my business for many years. üóº

As a creative, programming gives me the tools to develop all of my ideas and to keep me challenged every day. üå±

## Education üìì

üíª Makers Academy (Aug 21 to Dec 21)

After graduating Aulab, I applied to Makers, 16 week highly selective development BootCamp in London.

Maker's method was totally different from my previous school, being mostly based on self-led learning.
We started with TDD, testing Ruby programs we crafted with RSpec, followed by OOD, databases and web development. 

Makers taught me how to work In pairs and groups, as we where always working on different projects and it gave me confidence to build a full-stack application and use new technologies.

I've improved my Agile skills as well, especially during the three big group projects. 


üíª Aulab Hackademy (May 21 to Jul 21)

Aulab is a coding BootCamp in Italy, I enrolled their course where I started my journey to become a developer. 

It was 100% remote, with workshops in the morning and pairing sessions in the afternoon. 
During this time I've gained most of my Front End and styling skills, with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap projects. 

The second part was mostly focused on learning PHP, MVC framework Laravel, OOP and MySQL. During this time I've worked on a pairing project for a Dentist website and a group project for a Marketplace (named "Presto!").

During this course I was introduced to Agile methodology.
