</div>

I'm a curious and creative Junior Frontend Developer, coming from a Marketing and communication background, who graduated from Makers Academy in December 2021.
I moved to London in 2018 to improve my skills as a content creator and here I've found my new passion, or better, I like to say that programming found me instead. 👩🏻‍💻

I'm moved by knowledge and challenges, learning new things and putting them into practice has always been essential to me, in my 20s I moved to Tokyo, to learn Japanese, and in 2014 I've learned all that I needed to know about social media marketing, creating a Youtube Channel that has been my business for many years. 🗼

As a creative, programming gives me the tools to develop all of my ideas and to keep me challenged every day. 🌱

## Education 📓

💻 **Makers Academy** (Aug 21 to Dec 21)

After graduating Aulab, I was serious about coding. I resigned from my job and applied to Makers, a 16-week highly selective development bootcamp in London.

Maker's method was quite different from my previous course, being mostly based on **self-led learning**, **pairing sessions** and **weekend challenges**.
We started with a strong focus on **TDD**, testing **Ruby** programs we crafted with **RSpec**, followed by **BDD**, **OOD**, **databases**, **JavaScript**, **Jest** and other web development technologies. 

Makers taught me how to work solo, in pairs and group, as we were always working on different projects and it gave me the confidence to build full-stack applications and use new technologies without any fear.

I've improved my **Agile** skills as well, especially during the three big group projects, where we used **Trello** to organize our work, and allowed everyone the opportunity to act as **SCRUM master**. 


💻 **Aulab Hackademy** (May 21 to Jul 21)

Aulab is a coding BootCamp in Italy, I enrolled in their course where I started my journey to become a software developer. 

The lessons were 100% remote, with workshops in the morning and pairing sessions in the afternoon. 
During this time I've gained most of my front-end and styling skills, with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Bootstrap** projects. 

The second part was mostly focused on learning **PHP**, MVC framework **Laravel**, **OOP** and **MySQL**. During this time I've developed a few projects, including a final group project for a Marketplace application in Laravel (named "Presto!").

During this course, I was introduced to Agile methodology, SCRUM and Extreme Programming.

🎨 **Carrara Academy of Fine Arts** (Sept 2012 to Sept 2014)

I've enrolled a course called "New Technologies of Art" course, where I've learned about art through media like videomaking, photography and creative programming (Processing).
